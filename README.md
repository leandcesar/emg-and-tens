# EMG and TENS

Simple [EMG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography) and [TENS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcutaneous_electrical_nerve_stimulation) circuits for your arm to "control" someone else's arm.

## About

Inspired on [Backyard Brains](https://backyardbrains.com), I designed circuits to use your muscle signal (with EMG) to excite and contract another human's muscle (with TENS). For more infos, read the post "[Experiment: Advanced NeuroProsthetics: Take Someone's Free Will](https://backyardbrains.com/experiments/humanhumaninterface)" and/or watch Greg Gage's video "[How to control someone else's arm with your brain](https://www.ted.com/talks/greg_gage_how_to_control_someone_else_s_arm_with_your_brain?)" on TED.

## EMG

Electromyography (EMG) is an electrodiagnostic technique for evaluating and recording the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles. EMG is performed using an instrument called an electromyograph to produce a record called an electromyogram. An electromyograph detects the electric potential generated by muscle cells when these cells are electrically or neurologically activated.

## TENS

Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is the use of electric current produced by a device to stimulate the nerves for therapeutic purposes.The unit is usually connected to the skin using two or more electrodes. A typical battery-operated TENS unit is able to modulate pulse width, frequency and intensity.

#### Components 

- 2x 555;
- 1x 2N3053;
- 1x TIP122;
- 1x 7805;
- 1x Transformer 12V 100mA (~8:1);
- 2x 1N4004;
- Potentiometers: 10K ohm (2x) and 5K ohm (1x);
- Capacitors: 10uF (1x) and 100uF (1x);
- Resistors: 33K ohm (2x), 1K ohm (2x), 330 ohm (1x) and 220 ohm (4x);
- 3x LEDs.

## Arduino (optional)

To getting better results, you can use an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) connected between EMG output and TENS input. 

```C++
#define EMG A0
#define TENS D2

void setup() {
  pinMode(EMG, INPUT);
  pinMode(TENS, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(TENS, (analogRead(EMG) > 512));
}
```

## Experimental procedure

1. Place three surface EMG electrodes close to each other on the forearm.
2. Using the alligator clips, connect the middle electrode to EMG ground and the two others electrodes to EMG inputs.
3. Place two surface EMG electrodes close to each other across the ulnar nerve.
4. Using the alligator clips, connect the electrodes to TENS outputs.
5. Begin with the TENS device turned into the lowest setting.
6. Slowly begin to turn up the power of the TENS device until you see a response.

**Important:** if pulls their electrodes off before the TENS device is turned off it will cause the circuit to short and constantly send stimulation. Avoid this! To disarm the experiment, first turn off the TENS device totally.

**Note**: a TENS unit by definition delivers enough current to cause muscle contraction. Do not place electrodes across the muscles of the throat or the chest.
